# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Our analyis of Pewlett Hackard's retiring employees is twofold: 1) Determine the roles that individuals are retiring from and how many individuals per role and 2) Determine what individuals may be eligible for a mentorship program.

## Results
As we ran our anaylsis, we found that approximately 64% of the individuals eligible for retirement held titles including the word "Senior" which definitely signifies that a mentorship program needs to be established in order to back-fill those roles upon retirement of the existing senior individuals.

After running a mentorship eligibility query, we found that we had sufficient individuals in each department to develop a leadership pipeline.

# Summary
My first suggestion in order to best prepare for future retirement is to poll the eligible individuals in order to determine who is actually planning to retire, therefore we know how many positions we will potentially need to backfill. Secondly, of the individuals eligible to participate in the mentorship program, we also need to poll to see who is interested. If we do not have enough interest in the mentorship program, we may have to adjust our criteria with which we arrived at the mentorship eliibility.
